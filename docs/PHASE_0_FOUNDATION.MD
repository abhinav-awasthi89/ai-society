# Phase 0 - Foundational Blueprint

## ðŸŽ¯ Vision Statement
To develop an emergent, bottom-up AI-driven artificial society simulation that mimics generational evolution, behavioral inheritance, and emergent intelligence, potentially leading to the rise of self-developing artificial consciousness â€” a step toward next-generation AI.

## ðŸ“– Concept Glossary
- **Emergent AI**: Intelligence developed through bottom-up interactions instead of being hardcoded.
- **Rebirth Agents**: Special agents that retain generational memories across simulated rebirths.
- **Generational Memory**: Transfer of experiences and values through legacy systems rather than direct copies.
- **Social Norm Layers**: Dynamic layers that evolve based on agent interactions and affect behaviors.
- **Legacy Inheritance**: System by which knowledge, norms, and preferences persist post-death.

## âš™ Technical Assumptions and Goals
- Simulation is continuous, not restarted on system reboot.
- Multi-agent system with self-organizing behavior models.
- Rebirth agent memory modeling via internal vector embeddings.
- Modular architecture for extensibility and interoperability.

## ðŸ”‘ Core Principles
- **Bottom-Up AI Development**: Intelligence must emerge, not be programmed.
- **Continuity Beyond Human Oversight**: The system should function autonomously.
- **Generational Learning and Feedback Loops**: Legacy from previous generations affects future norms.
- **Ethical Open Source**: Transparent yet cautiously protected to prevent misuse/copying.
